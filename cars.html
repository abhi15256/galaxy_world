    <h3>Top 5 Fastest Cars</h3><br>
    <h4><i> Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+</i></h4>
    <p>
        <li>
            The standard Bugatti Chiron is already among the fastest cars in the world with a top speed of around 261 mph, but the French firm wanted to set a new record, so it created an even more potent beast.
         Bugatti took the slightly more powerful engine from the Centodieci, rated at 1,578 horsepower (99 more than the standard Chiron), added longer gear ratios to the gearbox, and crafted a revised aerodynamic package that increases the car’s length by almost 10 inches.
          The modified car hit a top speed of 304.7 mph on August 2. To celebrate the even, Bugatti is building a production model based on the prototype called the Chiron Super Sport 300+. This car is limited to 30 examples, enough to validate the speed record with the Guinness World Records.

     <h4>
        <i>Koenigsegg Agera RS</i></h4>
    <p>
        <li>The most powerful version of the Agera, the Agera RS, became the world’s fastest car on November 2017, when Koenigsegg hit an average speed of 277.9 mph.
             The record lasted less than two years, but the Agera RS still owns a handful of benchmarks, including acceleration from 0 to 200 mph, braking from 200 to 0 mph, and 0 to 200 mph and back to full stop. Unlike Bugatti,
             Koenigsegg didn’t build a limited-edition version of the Agera RS to celebrate the record, but the RS itself was limited to 25 examples.

     <h4><i> Hennessey Venom GT</i></h4>
    <p>
        <li>
            The Venom GT was introduced in 2011 and remained in production until 2017. Despite the seemingly long run, only 13 cars were built.
             Based on the Lotus Exige, the extensively modified Venom GT features a twin-turbo, 7.0-liter V-8 engine under the hood.
              Based on General Motors’ LS7 V-8, the unit pumps out up to 1,244 horsepower and 1,155 pound-feet of torque.
               The Venom GT hit its highest top speed in February 2014, when it reached 270.4 mph on Kennedy Space Center’s shuttle landing strip in Florida. 
               Although the speed was higher than the world record at the time, it did not qualify for the Guinness Book of Records because Hennessey’s run was in a single direction.
                Also, the limited production run of only 13 cars went against Guinness rules.

    <h4>
    <i>Bugatti Veyron Super Sport</i>
    </h4>
    <p>
        <li>
            The Bugatti Veyron may be five years old as of 2020, but it’s still among the fastest supercars ever built. 
            Actually, the record set by Bugatti in 2010 places the Veyron in fourth place with a top speed of 267.8 mph. 
            This benchmark was achieved with a beefed-up model called the Veyron Super Sport. 
            Bugatti built a special run of 30 cars called World Record Edition to celebrate the event, 
            but these vehicles are limited to 258 mph to protect the tires. The Super Sport was also the most powerful version of the Veyron, 
            with its 8.0-liter W-16 rated at 1,184 horsepower, 197 more than the regular model.
        </li>

    <h4><i>Bugatti Chiron</i></h4>
    <p>
        <li>
            The standard Bugatti Chiron made it on our list as one of four Bugattis. 
            Introduced in 2016 as a replacement for the Veyron, the Chiron retains the quad-turbo W-16 engine, 
            but power was upgraded to 1,479 horsepower and 1,180 pound-feet of torque. 
            The Chiron’s top speed is officially limited to 261 mph, which is a bit below the Veyron Super Sport. 
            On the other hand, the Chiron Super Sport tops the list with more than 300 mph, 
            so we know there’s plenty of potential under the hood.
