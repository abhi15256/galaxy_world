    <h3>Top 5 Fastest Bikes</h3><br>
    
    
    <h4><i> Dodge Tomahawk</i></h4>
    <p>
        <li>
        Dodge Tomahawk – top speed: 350 mph Even cars have a hard time keeping up with such raw speed.
       This superbike carries within it an 8277CC 10 valve, four stroke engine that is simply a dream.
       The dodge tomahawk has four wheels and each of them has its own suspension. Also, this is the same engine found in the Dodge Viper, (8.3-liter V10 Dodge Viper SRT10).
       The transmission on this bike is a two-speed manual toe shift and uses the traditional chain and sprocket system.
       The place that was supposed to house the headlights is actually a throttle intake and the bike also has a cooling system placed behind the intake manifold.
       The Dodge Tomahawk has no rival to this day, however, due to its four wheels and a few other reasons the bike isn’t certified for legal use in the USA.
       It can clock 0-60 somewhere in between 1.75 – 2.5 seconds and hits its max power of 500 HP at 5600 RPM.</li>

    <h4><i>Suzuki Hayabusa</i></h4>
    <p>
        <li>
        1340cc. It is a four-cylinder, short-stroke, DOHC, 16-valve engine that truly lives up to its hype. 
        The Suzuki Dual Throttle Valve ensures peak engine performance at all times. 
        This bike gives you the leverage to tweak its settings to its optimal with the ride-by-wire system combined with the Suzuki Drive Mode Selector. 
        The Suzuki Hayabusa hits 0-60 in 2.6 seconds and its clutch assists system, i.e. the Suzuki Clutch Assist System, helps reduce back torque. 
        It hits its max power of 197 HP at 6750 RPM.

    <h4><i>MTT Turbine Superbike Y2K</i></h4>
    <p>
     <li>
        This bike is one of the most powerful production motorcycles. 
        This beauty features the Rolls-Royce 250-C18 turbo shaft engine with a 2-speed semi-automatic transmission. 
        This bike can get from 0-60 in just 2.5 seconds. That’s probably the time you took to finish reading this sentence at the normal pace of reading.
         Go ahead, try it. The MTT Turbine Superbike Y2K hits its max power of 320 HP at 52000 RPM.

    <h4><i>Kawasaki Ninja H2R </i></h4>
    <p>
        <li>
        This one is another beast in the form of a bike. With a 998CC liquid cooled, 4 stroke , in-line four, DOHC, 16-valve engine this thing can go fast, and we mean fast! Due to its speed, Kawasaki managed to install an electronic rider support suite.
         It has the KTRC (Kawasaki Traction Control), KIBS (Kawasaki Intelligent anti-lock Brake System), KEBC (Kawasaki Engine Brake Control) and KLCM (Kawasaki Launch Control Mode). 
         These, apart from protection, keep the bike running smooth. The Kawasaki Ninja H2R hits 60 in a mere 2.5 seconds. Now that is fast! The bike hits it max power of 197.3 BHP at 11,000 RPM.

    <h4><i>Honda CBR 1100XX Blackbird</i></h4>
    <p> 
        <li>
        Honda CBR 1100XX Blackbird – top speed: 190 mph The blackbird is a revival bike that left its glorious past to make a better one. 
        With some little tweaks to the previous one launched in 1996, its back to its former glory, if not better. Packing an 1137 CC liquid cooled inline four cylindered engine, speed is at its beck and call. 
        The higher the RPM the smoother this bike can go. Hitting 0-60 in about 2.8 seconds, the Honda CBR 1100XX Blackbird is a precision instrument meant for speed. What it may lack in ride quality it makes up for in build and reliability. 
        It hits it the max power of 153 HP at 10000 RPM.</li></p>
