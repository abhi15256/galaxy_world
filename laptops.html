    <h3>Top 5 Laptops</h3><br>
    <h4><i> Macbook Pro (16-inch)</i></h4>
    <p>
        <li>
            The 16-inch MacBook Pro is just your type if you’ve been waiting for Apple to make a better keyboard. 
            The Magic Keyboard on this premium laptop ditches the Butterfly mechanism in favor of scissor switches, and the result is a much more comfortable typing experience. 
            You also get a bright and sharp 16-inch display with slimmer bezels, powerful performance from an available Core i9 CPU and robust AMD Radeon 5300M or 5500M graphics. <br> 

            <br> You can also configure the system with up to 64GB of RAM and 8TB of storage if you really want to splurge. 
            The 11 hours of battery life is another plus on this laptop, dwarfing the runtimes of its competitors. 
            The 16-inch MacBook Pro is pricey, and Apple still doesn’t include full-size USB ports, but overall this is the best laptop for creative pros.

    <h4><i>  Dell XPS 13</i></h4>
    <p>
        <li>
            The Dell XPS 13 is a serious workhorse.
             Powered by a 10th Gen Intel Core i7 processor with integrated Intel graphics, the notebook is ready for work or play 
             and with over 12 hours of battery life, you've got plenty of time for both, 
             The notebook consistently performed either better or on a par with competing systems. <br>

             <br>But rest assured, the laptop is just as pretty as it is powerful. The company managed to make a laptop that's smaller and lighter than previous models. 
             Despite the smaller size, Dell added some big changes, including a larger trackpad and keyboard. 
             Plus, you get the a 13.4-inch, near-bezeless display on every side –– the first in the world to do so. 

             It's an exercise in patient restraint, improving the notebook in a bunch of small ways that add up to a big leap for the system. 
             If you're looking for the total package, 
             the Dell XPS 13 is the laptop for you.

   <h4><i>Acer Swift 3 (2020, AMD Ryzen 7 4700U)</i></h4>
    <p>
        <li>
            The AMD version of the Acer Swift 3 is really the little laptop that could. 
            Armed with an AMD Ryzen 7 4700U processor and Radeon Graphics, the Swift 3 is taking on the likes of the MacBook Pro 13 and the XPS 13 with aplomb.
             And it's doing that for less than $700. And if you're curious, it smoked its Intel-powered counterpart as. <br>

            <br> The laptop served up surprising power on our benchmarks including overall and graphics performance. Plus, it has staying power with over 11 hours of battery life. Plus, it's got premium good looks and a rather comfortable keyboard. The laptop does have one flaw however, it's display which isn't as bright as we would like. But for the price, it's a minor quibble for a sub-$700 laptop that can best some of the most premium laptops on the market. With a herculean processor that whizzes past all its competitors, the Acer Swift 3 certainly earned its spot on this list.
